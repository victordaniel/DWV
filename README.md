Questionwhat do you mmean by parse function in pandas ? what is their functionality?
Answer:
        In Pandas, the parse function is not a built-in function, but rather refers to the various functions used for parsing (i.e., converting) data from one format to another.

For example, in the context of reading data from a CSV file, Pandas provides a read_csv() function that can parse the data in the file and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame object. This function takes various arguments that allow you to specify how the data should be parsed, such as the delimiter used to separate columns, the encoding of the file, and how to handle missing data.

Similarly, there are other parsing functions available in Pandas, such as read_excel() for parsing data from an Excel file, read_json() for parsing data from a JSON file, and to_datetime() for parsing date and time data in a DataFrame.

Overall, the parsing functions in Pandas provide a convenient way to read and manipulate data from various file formats and data sources.
